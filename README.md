# Goblin-Game
Game similar to hangman written in Java. 
Completed in my Data structure course in GMU under Professor Russell.

## Overview
Goblin-Game provides a command-line user interface where the user is prompted to guess a word from a given list of words. The user is only allowed one character at a time but the goblin will only allow two wrong guesses. If the user guesses wrong twice then the goblin wins. Otherwise, if the user guesses all the characters correct then the user wins.
